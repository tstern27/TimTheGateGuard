# TimTheGateGuard
This is my hobby discord bot. I mostly use and maintain this for my friends so the use case is a little narrow. 

Starting point of the youtube portion of the bot came from [here](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/master/examples/basic_voice.py)

The current features are as follows: 
- Youtube Bot that plays clips from just about anywhere (anything that yt_dlp supports) 
  - Added a timestamp capability to play sections of a video
  - Added more context tracking to allow any device to send command
- Ping command to track bots uptime

## Future Planned Features ##
- Soundboard Synced to emotes
- Admin controls 
- Statistics on usage (top played tracks, top users)
